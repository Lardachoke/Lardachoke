Heyo! I'm Jake, and I'm a student majoring in mathematics. I know this is outside of my field of study, but I really enjoy this stuff!
I have special interests in cryptography, cybersecurity, and games programming.
The languages I've gotten moderately profficent at are not many but I'm sure they'll grow. C, C++, Python, and French.
I really want to contribute to some games, and to be honest I just want to improve my understanding of cyberspace in general.
If you want to get in contact with me you can email me at jbatt3004@gmail.com.
Fun fact: Pittsburg produced more steel than the entire axis powers in WW2.
In my downtime I like to play chess, videogames, learn new skills (case in point), reading, golfing, gym, and I just generally like to have fun and be kind :)
Thanks for learning about me!
